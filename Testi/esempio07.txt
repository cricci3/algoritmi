IN OUR TIME 

Everybody was drunk. The whole battery was drunk going along the 
road in the dark. We were going to the Champagne. The lieutenant 
kept riding his horse out into the fields and saying to him, Tm drunk, I 
tell you, mon vioux. Oh, I am so soused'. We went along the road all 
night in the dark and the adjutant kept riding up alongside my kitchen 
and saying, ' You must put it out. It is dangerous. It will be observed* . 
We were fifty kilometres from the front but the adjutant worried about 
the fire in my kitchen. It was funny going along that road. That was 
when I was a kitchen corporal.
